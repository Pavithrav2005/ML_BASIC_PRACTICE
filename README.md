ðŸ§® NumPy Array Calculator
A simple command-line calculator built using NumPy that performs basic arithmetic operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division) on 1D NumPy arrays.

ðŸ“Œ Features
Takes two arrays as input from the user

Supports:

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division (with safe handling of division by zero)

Input validation for array size compatibility

ðŸš€ Getting Started
âœ… Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python and NumPy installed.

pip install numpy

ðŸ›  How to Run
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/numpy-array-calculator.git
cd numpy-array-calculator


Run the program:
python array_calculator.py

ðŸ’» Example
Enter the first array:
> 1 2 3

Enter the second array:
> 4 5 6

Select Operation:
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
> 1

Result of Addition: [5. 7. 9.]

ðŸ§  How It Works
The program:

Takes two 1D arrays as input from the user.

Checks if they have the same shape.

Asks the user to select an arithmetic operation.

Performs the operation using NumPy and prints the result.
